These SNMP MSSQL 2000 scripts were written by Nathan Haneysmith <nathan@hjksolutions.com>.
Please see the top of each script for information regarding their licensing.

Note that at this time, it appears munin snmpconf does not support require's inside tables, thus the snmpconf does not work.
You will need to manually create the links rather than using munin-node-configure --snmp / munin-node-configure-snmp to suggest them.

Also, Microsoft has dropped SNMP support for MS SQL after 2000, so you are currently out of luck there AFAIK.
